## NYC Airbnb Data Cleaning

**Notebook:** `notebooks/01_nyc_airbnb_data_cleaning.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates a production-style data cleaning workflow, including:
- before/after missingness checks
- schema and type verification
- explicit data validation
- lightweight sanity-check visualization

The focus is on pipeline correctness and downstream readiness rather than full EDA.
